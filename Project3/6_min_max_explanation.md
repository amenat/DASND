We iterate over array while keeping track of maximum and minimum values and return both values in end.

Time complexity:
    2 memory operations for initalizing min/mad variables
    2 memory operations while performing each iteration * n iterations
    1 operation for returning values

    We perform only one treversal, Hence complexity is O(n) i.e. linear.


Space complexity:
    O(1) as constant number of variables are used regardless of input size.
